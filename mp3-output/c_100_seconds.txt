see a statically typed procedural programming language famous for making the world go round it's the language behind many tools we take for granted like the windows Lennix and mac operating system kernels databases like MySQL interpreters for languages like python tools like van and get and countless others it was created in nineteen seventy two by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs where would be used to develop the unix operating system it would go on to become the mother of all languages inspiring the syntax of C. plus plus the sharp Java Java script Perl and PHP just to name a few it compiles directly to machine code and requires minimal runtime support but is platform dependent meaning the execute herbal is designed to run on a specific operating system it's a high level language designed for humans yet provides low level control over memory and hardware there's no garbage collector instead your code needs to manage its own memory when you create a variable it's a sign in address in memory you can store that address in another variable called a pointer when the variable is no longer needed you'll need to free it to avoid memory leaks to get started install a C. compiler a popular choice is the good news C. compiler or G. C. C. create a file ending in dot C. include any libraries you plan to use then add a main function to it this is where your program will start executing there's no function keyword and notice how it returns an integer type a return value of zero means success while a return value of one means failure there are only a few basic types and secretive variable by starting with the type followed by a name and value use print to print the value to the standard output or put an ampersand in front of it to reference its address in memory there's no string type but instead chart which represents a one byte character stored as an integer a string can be created with an array of characters each letter will have its own memory address can be terminated by a null character another approach is to start with the pointer by adding a star character in front of the tide then we can allocate four bytes to it now assigned a character to each index ending with the no character to create a string when you no longer need that memory allocated to your pro  Graham use free to release it back to the computer's ram the language is procedural and does not support object oriented features although you can create your own complex data types use instructs now compile your code to machine instructions for your operating system using the C. compiler this is been the C. programming language and one hundred seconds hit the like button and subscribe if you want to see more short videos like this thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one
