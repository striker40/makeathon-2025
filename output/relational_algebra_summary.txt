This video introduces relational algebra, a procedural query language used in databases. Here's a summary:

*   **What is Relational Algebra?** It's a set of operations performed on relations (tables) to produce new relations.  It's considered a procedural language because it specifies *how* to retrieve data, not just *what* data is needed.
*   **Why is it Important?** Relational algebra provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases, helps in understanding database operations, and enables writing optimized queries.
*   **Fundamental Operations (6):**
    *   Select
    *   Project
    *   Union
    *   Set Difference
    *   Cartesian Product
    *   Rename
*   **Additional Operations:**
    *   Set Intersection
    *   Join (Inner Join: Natural Join, Equi-Join, Theta-Join)
    *   Division
    *   Outer Join (Left, Right, Full)
*   **Operators:** unary and binary operators.
*   **Goal:** to understand the different operations and learn how to use them effectively.
