## What is Relational Algebra?
Relational Algebra is a procedural query language used in databases. It involves operations on relations (tables) to produce new relations. It's considered procedural because it specifies *how* to retrieve data, not just *what* data is needed.

## Why is it Important?
Relational algebra provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases, helps in understanding database operations, and enables writing optimized queries.
