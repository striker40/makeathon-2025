the one they come back  is one of the broad areas of mathematics we would have come across various algebra branches let's dig up dirt does your brother Mandy after Benji brought is to study the algebraic structures such as groups greens fees and abstract algebra has its wide application area in the field of cryptography coming too lenient attitude rather lenient as you read these with the linear regression linear mappings and is used in the application area like the better forecasting coming to Bali United you brought these bullying and you read these with the variables that dobby the truth value through our fault I do not do a house it's widespread applications in the areas of digital circuitry designed in personal computers pocket calculators CD players cell phones and other electronic products one such as your brother we are going to focus in today's presentation is the relational algebra and in today's presentation we are going to focus on the basics of relational algebra Y. eighty that step into the topic of the day the relational algebra and English philology blood is basically a procedural query language what do we mean by this it means we need to inspect what to do how do we are expecting the lizard from the database and the result is going to be a table in the nation I need not to get doctors say the table of the relation we need to inspect what is required and hope to retrieve that data on how to retrieve that he said and that is why we have for the national lead you asked for a procedural language if you are definitely watching this lecture I request you to navigate to chapter one of display list and find the lecture database languages that I have explained about the database languages the procedure I'll put a language and the non procedural body language with examples for now just understand relational algebra is a procedure ready language and what it actually does basically a relational  algebra is a set of operations on relations this is like the normalized recall petition that it's going to take input and it's going to produce the output they place you in a little less than that that is basically a set of operations under elections so it's going to work on the relation and does the operation and used it is said that the relational and that's why you see the list of algebra it's basically a set of operations and to be precise it is like a sex doll algebraic operations these are the big corporations like the editions of corruption all these big some values as the import and dust operation and produces the output like place you don't want to relational algebra is going to take relations as input does the operation and generates the old board which is also a relation in simple terms relational algebra is a set of operations which takes one or more relations as input and produces a relation as an output so that's what the next points if the input is going to be one or more relations and the output is going to be a relation and why one on motivations there are certain relational algebra operators which %HESITATION unity operators that it takes only one relation as an input there are certain relational algebra operators we day X. two or more input so they are binary alternatives so what do you mean to say is in a nutshell it takes one or more relations as an input and produces another relation as a note and why do we need to study this relational algebra because it provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases we know the buyer of relational databases in this contemporary but when we want to work on the relational database all I mean we want to know what the foundations of the relational database it's always recommended to have a sound knowledge on relational algebra because it provides a theoretical foundation for the relational databases the well known BBM with language that is widely used in today's world is the structure to bloody lab  S. Q. L. I mean you want to become proficient with SQL knowing relational algebra I will give you an additional advantage and not only that when we have a sound knowledge in the relational algebra obviously it allows us to understand database operations in more detail and also it motivates us to write optimized ladies we know databases are going to respond to queries mainly south they have plenty to the database database exits the body does the operation and give the decide if we want to get that help %HESITATION dead maybe multiple movies if you want an output from the database I mean a relational tables there can be multiple committees met these bodies gives disabled but giving an optimistic lady is always good because your databases will not take more pain more more memory to exec Uteck ready so what I meant to say is instead of giving up ready to the database if we given optimized to query the database with the spawned easily because this optimized ladies will be having lawyer cost cost is one of the factors that are used to measure the query optimization in simple terms relational algebra headsets to write optimized ladies and also it helps us to understand the database operations in more detail what's happening at the back and hope will reset proces hope ready execution plans are generated in hold up plans that exist you all these things no worries in the coming lectures we are going to focus on pretty optimization techniques at that time I will explain you hope what he optimization is actually taken care of by database we are done with the basics of relational algebra before we move on to the next light just revisit what is relational algebra it is a set of operations what are the operations that relational algebra contains that's what we are going to see now basically the relational algebra operations are classified into two categories number one the fundamental operations and number two the additional operations let's just focus on the names of the operation  and in this lecture in the coming lectures we are going to focus on all the operations one by one indeed a levy to quiet examples for now let's just know the operation names talking about the fundamental operations they're not six fundamental operations Espinasse relational algebra is concerned the first operation is select the second operation is project the third one is union the fourth one is the same difference so if the one is the cartesian product and the last fundamental operation internationalize you brought the six to one it is the rename operation these six operations are the fundamental operations into less than I do but I  I'm coming to the additional operations we have various additional operations international algebra they are the same section operation the US mainland operation the inner join then in inner join we are going to focus on the natural joint equi join and Pete that's alright but at emphasis in this subject will be more on natural joint and the next additional operation is the division operation I'm the last additional operation that we are going to focus on in the subject is the auto giant then we are going to see three forms of all join the left outer join the right elbow joint and the follow to join so we have seen about the various fundamental and additional operations in the coming lectures we are going to focus on all the operations one by one exactly and that's it guys I hope you guys enjoyed this presentation I thank you for watching
